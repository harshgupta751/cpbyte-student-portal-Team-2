### Documentation

#### Importing and using the Insomnia Request Collection

The backend directory contains a folder called `insomnia/`. This directory contains an Insomnia request collection which can be imported directly into Insomnia for testing.

[Download Insomnia Client](https://insomnia.rest/) \
[Importing Collections](https://docs.insomnia.rest/insomnia/import-export-data)

**Note:** The collection may be used with other HTTP REST clients as well, such as Postman, Hoppscotch or Thunder Client. But it is untested on those clients.
